## Although you are allowed to make up your own names for variables, you must follow these rules: ##
* You cannot use one of Python's key words as a variable name. (SeeTable 1-2 for a list of the key words.)
* A variable name cannot contain spaces.
* The first character must be one of the letters a through z, A through Z, or an under-score character (- ).
* After the first character you may use the letters a through zor A through 2,the dig- its O through 9, or underscores.
* Uppercase and lowercase characters are distinct. This means the variable name
Itemsordered is not the same as itemsordered.
